## 📓 Project Overview

This project was developed entirely in a single Jupyter Notebook:  
📘 **[`Siamese_Network_OneShot.ipynb`](Siamese_Network_OneShot.ipynb)**

Key features:
- Engineered a deep learning model that learns **discriminative embeddings** for image similarity tasks
- Trained using **contrastive loss** on paired image inputs
- Evaluated with **classification metrics** and **embedding visualizations**
- Demonstrated use cases like identity verification and one-shot learning scenarios

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
